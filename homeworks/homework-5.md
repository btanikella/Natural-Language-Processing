Part-of-speech tagging
----------

This homework is about part-of-speech tagging. Your data will be from
Twitter. Select three English-language tweets that youâ€™d like to work
with.

Using the annotation framework described in
[this paper](http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/gimpel+etal.acl11.pdf), label the part-of-speech
tags of each word in your three tweets.

Next, using the
[Penn Treebank part-of-speech tags](http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/ccalas/tagsets/upenn.html),
annotate the fine-grained POS tag of each **verb** in your data (e.g.,
VBD, VBZ, MD). You do not need to do the non-verbs.

Finally, using the
[Brown part-of-speech tagset](http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/ccalas/tagsets/brown.html),
annotate the fine-grained POS tag of each **verb** in one sentence of
your data (e.g., MD*, MD+HV, VBG+TO). Try to choose a sentence that
involves a tag that is not covered in the previous two tagsets.
