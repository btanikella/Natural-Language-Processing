Derivational morphology
-----------------------

Select a news article in English (or another language you read and can explain), and identify any words with three or more morphemes. If there are no such words, find another news article!

Show how each word breaks down into morphemes, and indicate which is the stem and which are affixes. Indicate whether the affixes cause a part-of-speech change.

For example, "derivational" breaks down as “derive”+”ation”+”al”,
where “derive” is the stem (and a verb), “-ation” nominalizes it, and
then “-al” makes it into an adjective.
