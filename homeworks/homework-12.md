Discourse parsing
----------

In this homework, you will RST annotation of a short passage of text.

Provide an RST parse tree for the following text, which I have already segmented into discourse units. You can indicate the discourse parse either through a graph or through a list of relations. A description of the relations in RST can be found at
[http://www.sfu.ca/rst/01intro/intro.html](http://www.sfu.ca/rst/01intro/intro.html)

Here is the passage (note that my segmentation:

- 1. In today's society, college is ambiguous.
- 2. We need it to live, 
- 3. but we also need it to love.
- 4. Moreover, without college most of the world's learning would be egregious.
- 5. College, however, has myriad costs.
- 6. One of the most important issues facing the world is how to reduce college costs.
- 7. Some have argued that college costs are due to the luxuries students now expect.
- 9. Others have argued that the costs are a result of athletics.
- 10. In reality, high college costs are the result
  of excessive pay for teaching assistants.

This passage is from Lee Perelman's amusing [Essay for Robo-Reader](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Essays-for-Robo-Reader.pdf).
If you have taken the GRE, or think you might take it, I recommend you read it.
