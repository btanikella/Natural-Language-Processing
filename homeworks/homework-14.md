Final project feedback
----------

Please help your classmates improve their final projects.  For two of
the project proposals, please ask a question or make a suggestion that
naturally arises from the proposal.

You may not use questions or ideas that were given by others in the
class, but feel free to use a question or idea that you yourself
raised during class.

Submit your questions or suggestions on T-Square by 3:05 on Friday.
