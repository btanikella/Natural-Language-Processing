Frame semantics
----------

In this homework, you will perform a frame semantic analysis on a few sentences.

Here are a few references to help:

- http://verbs.colorado.edu/propbank/framesets-english/
- http://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/ace/FramingGuidelines.pdf
- http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/demo/srl/index.php. Pay attention to the columns labeled SRL. The other columns are interesting, but somewhat different from what we discussed in lecture.

Everybody should analyze this sentence:

“Wind gusts as strong as 99 mph battered the south coast of England, and authorities warned of travel disruptions across the region.”

Pick two other sentences from the news to analyze.
