Labeled Dependency Parsing
----------

- Choose a wikipedia page, and select two sentences to dependency
parse. You will prefer short sentences, but make sure there is a
verb. Identify the edge types. You may check your parse using the
[Stanford Parser](http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/index.jsp), but please try it on your own first. You may disagree with the parser; please note any disagreements.
- This manual defines the set of dependency types:
http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/dependencies_manual.pdf
- Next, apply the Stanford Parser to this sentence:

"The moment one learns English, complications set in." (Felipe Alfau)

Do you agree with the resulting parse? If not, how would you change it?
