Go to Google News or some other daily news site. Find three sentences
that you feel have multiple interpretations besides the intended
one. Headlines are particularly good for this. For each interpretation, write down the meaning, and say why each interpretation will or will not be preferred by the reader. Examples may be in any language, but you must be able to explain them in English.

Please submit your answers online by class time at 3pm on
thursday. Also bring a paper copy to class.
